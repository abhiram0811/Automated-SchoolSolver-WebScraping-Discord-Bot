# SchoolSolver-Discord-Bot
A cloud based Web Scraping discord bot which sends a message in channel regarding the question details, whenever a new question is added in the School Solver Website.

The bot is built on the incredibly helpful website Replit, a cloud-based platform (https://replit.com/). On a free plan, it permits code to execute without charge for one hour. To ensure that the bot runs forever, I built a straightforward web server for it using Flask and then used uprising bot to ping it continuously every five minutes (https://uptimerobot.com/dashboard#788400819).
